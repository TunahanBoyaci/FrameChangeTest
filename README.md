## Overview
This code demonstrates how to navigate and interact with different iframes within a web page using Selenium WebDriver. It covers switching between frames, performing actions within frames, and selecting options from a dropdown. The code seems to be part of a broader testing framework, given the usage of a base driver and custom methods.
